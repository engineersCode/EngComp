# Engineering Computations

The first module of this course, [_"Get data off the ground"_](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/1_offtheground),
assumed no coding experience and created a foundation with Python programming constructs and data structures.
You learned to play with strings, lists and NumPy arrays, using indexing, slicing, for- and if-statements, and functions.
The second course module explores practical statistical analysis with Python.

## Module 2: Take off with stats

### [Lesson 1](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp2lesson1): Cheers! Stats with beers

Exploratory analysis using a data set of canned craft beers in the US. Introduces the `pandas`library and its data types: Data Frames and Series. Use `pandas` to read a data file, extract selected columns, and remove null values. Descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency and variability. Distribution plots: histograms with Matplotlib. Comparing with a normal distribution.

### [Lesson 2](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp2lesson2): Seeing stats in a new light

Continuing with the data set of canned craft beers, this lesson focuses on _visualizing statistics_. For quantitative data: histograms and box plots; for categorical data: bar plots. Visualizing multiple data with scatter plots and bubble charts.

### [Lesson 3](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp2lesson3): Lead in lipstick

A full worked example using what you learned in lessons 1 and 2: using data from studies by the US Food and Drug Administration on the lead content in lipstick, we fact-check alarming news headlines. Based on Prof. Kristin Sainani's lecture, ["Exploring real data: lead in lipstick,"](https://youtu.be/nlKIT-_b2jU) of her Stanford Online course ["Statistics in Medicine."](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/MedStats-SP/SelfPaced/about)

### [Lesson 4](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp2lesson4): Life expectancy and wealth

Deeper dive into `pandas`, using data for life expectancy and per-capita income over time, across the world. Inspired by the work of Hans Rosling.
Pandas methods: `head()`, `info()`, `value_counts()`, `groupby()`, `describe()`, `groupby.first()`, `groupby.get_group()`, `idxmin()`
Categorical data type.
Bubble plots, spaghetti plots, and interactive widgets.
